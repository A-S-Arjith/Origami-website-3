    <h2>About Origami Design</h2>
    <a href="index.html">Back to Index</a>
    <p> I am just a kid (Who wishes his/her name to be Anonymous) who is interested in coding by using Whitehat Jr, AKA BYJU'S Future School. This is a project from class 49-52. On this, I gather some of the origami animals you would like to make to save you some time.
    </p>
    <p> If you send this to other people, I would appreciate it as:</p>
    <p>- I will get popular</p>
    <p>- BYJU'S Future School would provide more people with the ability to code</p>
    <p>- I WILL GET A FREAKIN MACBOOK IF 5 OF YOU GUYS JOIN BYJU'S Future School</p>
    <p>(But it is your choice)</p>
